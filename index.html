<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>AnamorphicDesqueezer</strong></p>
<p>Effective date: January 4, 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
AnamorphicDesqueezer respects your privacy. This app is designed to desqueeze
anamorphic photos and videos, including batch processing, entirely on your device.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, sell, or share any personal data.
The app does not require user accounts or authentication.
</p>

<h2>2. Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>
<p>The app may request access to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Camera</strong> – to capture photos and videos with real-time anamorphic preview.</li>
  <li><strong>Photo Library (Read)</strong> – to allow selection of existing photos and videos for desqueeze.</li>
  <li><strong>Photo Library (Add)</strong> – to save exported desqueezed photos and videos back to your device.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All access is initiated by the user and used only for the app’s core functionality.
</p>

<h2>3. Batch Desqueeze Processing</h2>
<p>
The app supports batch desqueeze, allowing users to process multiple photos
and/or videos in one operation. All batch processing is performed locally on
the device. No media files are uploaded to any server.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
AnamorphicDesqueezer does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs,
tracking technologies, or cloud services.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Since no data is collected, no personal information is stored for any user.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>

If future updates introduce features that affect privacy, this policy will be
updated accordingly and reflected in the App Store privacy disclosures.
